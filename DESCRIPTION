Description: This R package provides functions for distribution fitting 
  of discrete count distributions. Included are the Poisson, the negative binomial and most importantly 
  a new implementation of the Poisson-beta distribution (density, distribution and quantile function and 
  random number generation) together with a needed new implementation of Kummer's function (also: confluent 
  hypergeometric function of the first kind). Three implemented Gillespie algorithms allow synthetic data 
  simulation via the basic, switching and bursting mRNA generating process, respectively. Finally 
  likelihood functions for one population and two population mixtures - with and without zero-inflations - 
  allow distribution fittings of the Poisson, negative binomial and the Poisson-beta distribution. 
  The package depends on the MPFR/GMP libraries which need to be installed separately 
  (see description at <https://github.com/fuchslab/scModels>). 
  scModel is accompanying the paper "Probability distributions for single cell mRNA counts" 
  by Lisa Amrhein, Kumar Harsha and Christiane Fuchs.
