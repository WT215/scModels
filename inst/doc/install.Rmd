## About GSL

The [GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) is a numerical library for C and C++ programmers. It is free software under the GNU General Public License.

The library provides a wide range of mathematical routines such as random number generators, special functions and least-squares fitting. There are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite. The implementation of the confluent hypergeometric function is used in this package.

## About RcppGSL

The [RcppGSL](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.gsl.html) package provides an easy-to-use interface between GSL data structures and GNU R using concepts from Rcpp which is itself a package that eases the interfaces between R and C++. This package also serves as a prime example of how to build a package that uses 'Rcpp' to connect to another third-party library.

## Installation
### Installation on Linux variants

On Ubuntu, the **libgsl** packages are available. The following command will get it up and running:

> sudo apt install libgsl2 libgsl-dev gsl-bin

Similarly named packages can be found for other distributions as well.

### Installation on Mac

GSL is fairly easy to install on a Mac if [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is already available.

> brew install gsl

Without a package manager, the library will have to be compiled from source that can be fairly tedious.

### Installation on Windows

Installation on Windows requires building GSL with the recommended toolchain for R.

Pre-compiled libraries have been put together by Prof. Brian Ripley and are available on his [webpage](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/). The files are under [goodies/multilib](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/goodies/multilib/) directory. This includes a 'local' tree, named as [local323.zip](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/goodies/multilib/local323.zip) at the time this manual was prepared, that contains the headers and static libraries for GSL.

The following instructions are vaild for Windows 8 and above.

* The local323.zip has to be extracted at a convenient place. The C: drive is the location for the screenshots used in this manual.
* The location of the library needs to be added to the environment variables of the system. There are two ways to get to the list of environment variables:
    + Select Computer -> System properties in the Explorer.  
    ![](windows-1.png)  
    In the next window, select Advanced system settings.  
    ![](windows-2.png)
    
    + Use the Windows search bar  
    ![](windows-3.png)
* The location needs to be added against the variable LIB_GSL.
    ![](windows-4.png)
    ![](windows-5.png)
    ![](windows-6.png)
    ![](windows-7.png)
* Rstudio (or the current R session) has to be restarted so that these environment variables can be read.
* The RcppGSL package has to be installed to complete the configuration of GSL development libraries with R. It is worth noting that installing the mpb2 package will take care of this step anyway.
